Letâ€™s calculate the same probability for our cod fish population.

We know that cod have an average weight of 36 lbs with a standard 
deviation of 20. We want to try to fit 25 cod fish into our same crate that can hold up to 750 lbs.

Our first step is to calculate the standard error for a sample size 
of 25. Using the above information, calculate the standard error and assign it to a variable called standard_error.


Now that we have our standard error, we can use the normal CDF to calculate 
the probability that a sample of 25 fish has a mean weight of 30 lbs. Using the 
function stats.norm.cdf(), calculate this probability and assign it to a variable cod_cdf.


Given the probability you calculated in the last checkpoint, would you recommend trying to carry 25 cod in the crate?

## Setting up our parameters
std_dev = 20
samp_size = 25
standard_error = std_dev / (samp_size**.5)

mean = 36
x = 750/25
cod_cdf = stats.norm.cdf(x,mean,standard_error)
