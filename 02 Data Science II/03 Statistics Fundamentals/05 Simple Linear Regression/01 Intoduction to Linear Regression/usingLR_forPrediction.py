'''
In script.py, youâ€™ll see the code (from the previous exercise) to fit a 
model that predicts test score using hours_studied. Print the coefficients of this model using .params.
'''

'''
Using your model, what is the predicted score for a student who spent 3 hours 
studying? Save the result as pred_3hr and print it out. Calculate your answer 
by plugging into the formula for a line (instead of using .predict()).
'''

'''
What is the predicted score for a student who spent 5 hours studying? Use the .predict() 
method to calculate your answer and save it as pred_5hr, then print it out.
